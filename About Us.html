	 <h1> Medical Doctor </h1>

    
<p> <img src="image/amos.png" width="240" height="240"; draggable="true" class="float-img"/>Dr.Godspower is one of the foremost 
Interventional Cardiovascular Specialists in 
Nigeria and the US. He is the founder/Medical 
Director of First Cardiology Consultants based in Lagos. 
Prior to establishing his company, he served as the former Director 
of Vascular Cardiology in one of the top cardiology practices in the US. 
In this article, Dr. Johnson discusses discovering his talent as a child, 
his professors that inspired him to study surgery, and what it takes to be 
successful in the field I grew up in Lagos, and attended Kingâ€™s College, 
Lagos. 
<P>When I was a kid, I was quite playful, but I somehow managed to do
 well in my exams. However, during my childhood, I was always interested 
 in science and liked to perform experiments. I was also good with my hands; 
 therefore, my parents advised me to do medicine and become a surgeon.
 After secondary school, I went on to the University of Lagos to study medicine, 
 which was in 1975. My first real inspiration to become a surgeon happened during
 my housemanship in Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), where I had the 
 privilege of working under professors Amaku and Esho.</p> 
 <P>They were great surgeons and that was when it clicked that this is what I wanted to do. My primary
 assignment during NYSC, between 1981 and 1982, in a village was near Auchi
 in Bendel State then (now split between Delta and Edo States), after which 
I went to the United States to specialize in public health and preventive medicine at Yale University. 
  <P>Coincidentally, three Nigerians in my Yale set were honours students. After graduation, 
I went on to Columbia University for my internal medicine and cardiology residency, 
where another mentor, Dr. Jay Brown, an African American, gave me all the motivation I needed 
to become an interventional cardiologist, 
which was a very competitive 
specialty with hardly any black cardiologists.
